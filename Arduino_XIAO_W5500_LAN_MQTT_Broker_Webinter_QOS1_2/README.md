The XIAO W5500 Ethernet Adapter is a ompact PoE development board featuring the XIAO ESP32S3 Plus, 
with an integrated, isolated PoE module and TPS563201-based power conversion that delivers a clean 5V supply to power the microcontroller. 
Ideal for IoT projects, where a versatile combination of reliable Ethernet connectivity and low-power wireless processing simplifies 
installation and enhances system performance.

Here the LAN connection is used to get a wired connection between the local broker and the router.
